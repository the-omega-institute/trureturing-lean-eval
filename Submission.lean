# The Hopf problem: a complex structure on the 6-sphere

Does `S⁶` admit a complex structure? Posed by Hopf (1948) and **open**: `S²`
and `S⁶` are the only spheres admitting almost complex structures
(Borel–Serre), and on `S⁶` neither the integrability of some almost complex
structure nor its impossibility has been established. LeBrun (1987) ruled out
complex structures orthogonal for the round metric; claimed resolutions in
both directions have not achieved community acceptance.

The two holes ask for the affirmative resolution as a holomorphic atlas on
the topological 6-sphere: chart data into `ℂ³`, plus the proof that all
transition functions are `ℂ`-analytic (`ω`, mathlib's rendering of "complex
manifold"). No compatibility with the standard smooth atlas is demanded:
every smooth homotopy 6-sphere is diffeomorphic to the standard `S⁶`
(Smale's h-cobordism theorem and `Θ₆ = 0`, Kervaire–Milnor), so filling the
holes is equivalent to putting a complex structure on the smooth `S⁶`.
Compare `LeanEval.Geometry.NewlanderNirenberg`: by that theorem it would
suffice to integrate one of the known almost complex structures.

Unlike the other problems in this benchmark, a comparator-accepted solution
would constitute new mathematics, not a reconstruction of known mathematics.
