# The admissible 50-tuple of diameter 246

`H50` is Engelsma's narrowest admissible 50-tuple (diameter 246), the tuple
Polymath8b uses for `H₁ ≤ 246`.

Both the diameter (`= 246`) and admissibility are re-verified in-kernel by
`decide` on the explicit `Finset` literal — the literal is not trusted, the
kernel checks it — exactly as the 600 development does for its 105-tuple
`H105` (`PrimeGapsTheory.NumberTheory.Admissible`), including the raised `maxRecDepth`
needed to evaluate the 50-deep `insert` chain.
