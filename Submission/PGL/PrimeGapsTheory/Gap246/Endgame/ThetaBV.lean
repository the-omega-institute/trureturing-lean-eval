# A Bombieri–Vinogradov-only certificate-admissible level

`lem_theta_bv`: any strict certificate value `Q > 4` leaves a nonempty
window `2/Q < θ < 1/2`, and Bombieri–Vinogradov supplies distribution at every
such `θ`.  The proof chooses the midpoint of that interval.

/-- **`lem_theta_bv`.** Under Bombieri–Vinogradov (`hBV` gives level of distribution
for every `θ' < 1/2`), there is a certificate-admissible level `θ` at which the primes
have level of distribution `θ`; the proof takes the midpoint of `(2/Q, 1/2)`. This is
the sole analytic black box of the `246` development, as in the 600 development. -/
