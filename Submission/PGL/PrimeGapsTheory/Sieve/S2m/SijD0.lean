# The S2m sij bound at D0

Aggregator for the `SijD0/` directory, which proves the bound on the sij sum at `D0`. `GTail`
bounds the guarded g-tail, `MertensFactorG` builds the Mertens-type factor for `g`, and
`PairMasterG` gives the pointwise pair-master majorant; `Main` assembles these into
`lem_S2m_sij_D0`. This module only re-exports those parts.
