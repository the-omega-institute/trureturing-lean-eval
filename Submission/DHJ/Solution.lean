# Proofs of the asymptotic forms of the density theorems

This module proves the asymptotic density theorems, deriving them from the explicit
threshold forms `Combinatorics.Line.exists_of_density` and
`Combinatorics.ArithmeticProgression.exists_of_density_nat` developed in this repository.

A *combinatorial line* in the cube of words of length `n` over a finite alphabet `α` is a family
of `#α` words, one for each letter `x : α`, obtained from a single pattern by filling every
occurrence of a wildcard with `x`; at least one coordinate must be a wildcard, so distinct
letters give distinct words. This is Mathlib's `Combinatorics.Line α (Fin n)`, and `l x` is the word
of the line indexed by the letter `x`.
